Searching for Unmodeled Physics in LALInference with Coherent Splines     Talk     GWANW_2019_talk     2019-06-25     LIGO Hanford Observatory     https://bruce-edelman.github.io/files/SearchingForUnmodeledPhysics.pdf     I gave a talk summarizing my current research in gravitational wave data analysis. Specifically thi tak covers a project in where I was able to create a model to desribe and fit general deviations of gravitiational wave data from General Relativity or current LIGO modeled waveforms.
