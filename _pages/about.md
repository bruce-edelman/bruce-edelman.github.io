## Bruce Edelman
  I am an Astrophysics PhD student at the University of Oregon, under Professor Ben Farr. I am a memeber of the LIGO/VIRGO Science Collaboration working hard searching for and analyzing Graviatational waves! I specialize and Bayesian Inference of gravitiational wave data sepcifically on estimating the source parameters and properties of the gravitiaaonal ave origin. 
  I grew up in a small town in Indiana where I met my wonderful wife Lydia. I then did my undergraduate degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. During my time at Purdue I worked with Professor Chen-Lung Hung in his ultracold molecules and quantum gas laboratory where I helped create a Rb and Cs laser system to be used to trap ultracold Rb-Cs molecules and to help create Rb based quantum gasses or Bose-Einstein Condensates. Here I gained good experienece in learning how laser systems work including all the electronics, optics and other components necessary to get the entire system working properly. 
  Now I don't work in labs anymore and just work at my laptop where I spend most of my time coding analysis software or scripts for doing Gravitational Wave data analysis. During this time I have learned a great deal about data analysis and data science while also gaining invaluable skills, such as Python, C/C++, Git, CI/CD, Shell, R, and Machine Learning / Probalistic Programming packages and techniques. 
   I also have a great deal of interest in politics and the science and data around polling and visualizing polling data. Related to this I am also interested in how data and data-oriented thinking can fit into the world of politics and policy in the post-truth world we now live in. It is ironic that we now live in a time where there is enormous amounts of data on nearly every subject imaginable but we have not transistioned into a data-oriented society where we can take advantage of this data to really overhaul how we decide major decisions in policy from an objective look at the world rather than making deicisions on emotional biases.
